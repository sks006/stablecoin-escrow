# 🏦 Neobank Infrastructure: Just-In-Time Stablecoin Escrow

This repository houses the high-throughput settlement layer for a European crypto-backed neobank, enabling Just-in-Time (JIT) funded debit/credit card infrastructure with real-time atomic settlement ($<$1.5s target latency) over `EURC` and `USDC`.

The architecture implements a dual-pathway workspace designed to contrast standard framework footprint against zero-allocation, bare-metal runtime execution.

## ⚙️ The Zero-Allocation Execution Pipeline

The bare-metal implementation guarantees minimal Compute Unit (CU) consumption by systematically bypassing runtime heap allocation and Borsh serialization.

### 1. Memory Topography (`state.rs`)

Defines the `NativeEscrowState` structure strictly utilizing `#[repr(C)]` layout configurations to preserve predictable struct fields in memory. The layout spans exactly 204 bytes, packed and padded to align flawlessly with 8-byte CPU word boundaries to avoid pointer misalignments.

### 2. O(1) Instruction Routing (`processor.rs`)

Directly intercepts the raw `&[u8]` instruction buffer sent by the Sealevel Virtual Machine (SVM). It inspects index `0` of the slice to instantly evaluate the instruction variants:

* `0` $\rightarrow$ `Initialize`
* `1` $\rightarrow$ `ExecuteTransfer`
* `2` $\rightarrow$ `CancelEscrow`

The remainder of the slice (`&instruction_data[1..]`) is forwarded downstream as raw arguments, avoiding intermediate heap allocation.

### 3. Bootstrapping Engine (`initialize.rs`)

Overcomes the **Gatekeeper Paradox** by performing structural evaluation of account state before enforcing ownership constraints. If an account is unallocated (`data_len == 0`), it invokes `solana_program::system_instruction::create_account` using `invoke_signed` with a multidimensional seed matrix to assign program ownership and lock down the memory boundary before zero-copy casting.

## 🛡️ Rigorous Edge-Case Mechanical Specification

### 1. Initialize Gateways

* **Insufficient Payer Sol Balance:** If the `maker` lacks the exact lamports required for rent exemption of a 204-byte structure ($204\text{ bytes} + \text{account metadata}$), the system instruction triggers a structural panic before state mutation occurs.
* **Fee Bounded Ranges:** Instruction data parsing validates that `transfer_fee_bps <= 10000`. Any values outside this ceiling immediately exit with `EscrowError::InvalidAmount`.
* **PDA Invariant Verification:** The exact address derivation parameters are verified explicitly:

$$\text{Seeds} = [\text{"escrow"}, \text{maker\_pubkey}, \text{taker\_pubkey}, \text{mint\_pubkey}]$$



Any structural variance triggers `EscrowError::InvalidEscrowPDA`.

### 2. Execute Transfer (Settlement) & Token-2022 Protocol Dust

* **Token-2022 Extension Traps:** When executing transactions across tokens using the Token-2022 standard, dynamic features such as transfer fees or interest accumulation can cause the real balance of the `escrow_vault` to deviate from the immutable `amount` stored in the state struct.
* **The Dust-Sweep Mechanic:** Rather than relying entirely on state values, `execute_transfer.rs` reads the live data slice of the `escrow_vault` token account post-transfer. Any leftover fractional amounts ("dust") are automatically swept into the `maker`'s account during the final account closing phase.
* **The Atomic Teardown Sequence:** To reclaim the rent lamports safely, the program calls the SPL Token program's `close_account` instruction. The target account is permanently deleted, and its rent balance is swept directly back to the `maker`.

### 3. Cancel Escrow (Reclamation)

* **Authority Identity Lock:** Only the designated `cancel_authority` (the neobank settlement wallet) can execute a cancellation. Attempts by the `maker` or any external wallet to force an unauthorized refund return `EscrowError::InvalidAuthority`.
* **Zeroed Account Guard:** If a transfer has already settled, the account's initialization discriminator is wiped, and its data length is effectively neutralized. Subsequent cancel commands fail immediately due to invalid layout identification.

### 4. Zero-Copy Hardening

* **Memory Borrow Invariants:** To prevent overlapping mutable references, `try_borrow_mut_data` is contained within a dedicated scope block. This ensures that the state reference is dropped before invoking any downstream Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs).

---


### 🧪 1. The In-Process Foundry (`litesvm_tests.rs`)

Standard Solana testing uses `solana-test-validator`, which requires spinning up an entire local RPC server, generating blocks, and dealing with network latency.

**LiteSVM** bypasses the network layer entirely. It is an in-process instance of the Sealevel Virtual Machine.

* **The Advantage:** It executes bare-metal SVM instructions in milliseconds.
* **The Objective:** You use this suite to fire corrupted byte arrays at `processor.rs`. You test offset misalignments, invalid 105-byte lengths, and discriminator mismatches. This proves your zero-copy `try_from_bytes_mut` gates are impenetrable before touching a live network.

### 🏄‍♂️ 2. Mainnet Hydration (`surfpool.toml` & `utils.ts`)

Mocking tokens in local development is a fatal trap. If you mock a standard SPL token, your tests will pass. But the moment you deploy and interface with the real `EURC` or `USDC`, your program crashes because the real tokens might utilize Token-2022 extensions (like Interest-Bearing structures, Transfer Hooks, or Default Account States).

**Hydration** means pulling the exact physical memory state of the mainnet `EURC` mint account directly into your local test validator.

* **The Objective:** We force your `execute_transfer` and dust-sweep logic to interact with the exact byte layout of the production European stablecoin. If the Token-2022 protocol intercepts a fraction of a cent during the transfer, your test suite will catch the dust anomaly immediately.

### ⏱️ 3. The Performance Proof (`anchor_escrow.ts` vs `zero_escrow.ts`)

This is the entire reason we built the bare-metal pathway. You must write a test assertion that captures the exact Compute Unit (CU) consumption of both programs executing the exact same settlement flow.

* **The Assertion:** The test must physically fail if `Native_CU` is not drastically lower than `Anchor_CU`. This proves to the neobank's financial modelers that our transaction overhead is minimized, increasing profitability per card swipe.

---

### 🧨 The Final Settlement Block

To write these tests, we must finish the settlement logic. In the TypeScript integration suite, you will have to assert that the `escrow_vault` token account no longer exists after the test runs, and that the `maker`'s SOL balance increased by the exact rent-exemption amount.

This brings us right back to the uncompleted CPI in `execute_transfer.rs`.

To physically delete that vault and trigger the rent sweep, you must command the SPL Token Program via the `close_account` instruction. The virtual machine requires exactly three physical accounts in the payload to authorize this ledger reclamation.

Map the structure. Which three distinct participants fill these abstract slots?

1. **Target** `[The account to be destroyed]` $\rightarrow$ ?
2. **Destination** `[The account receiving the swept lamports]` $\rightarrow$ ?
3. **Authority** `[The cryptographic entity legally allowed to authorize destruction]` $\rightarrow$ ?

### Edge case handling 
#### 1. dust,
#### 2. sweep,
#### 3. RAW,
#### 4. hazard,
#### 5. Merkle,
#### 6. proof,
#### 7. bootstrapping.
